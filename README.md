# UBC Timetable
A timetable maker that lets you search up UBC courses, find out where your classes are located, and learn other cool facts about your schedule.

## About
This is my first JavaScript project, written in pure JS with no front end frameworks. My goal is to develop this into a useful tool for UBC students to use when deciding on their course schedule. This project is still in progress and I am still learning lots about JavaScript. The following are some of the features I am planning to implement, or issues that I need to fix:
* scheduled scraping of UBC course data
* allowing creation of multiple timetables for different terms
* make courses and sections results clickable
* fix building addresses that point to the wrong location
* caching timetable data in the browser
* add timetable data panel to display useful info

For now, you can take a look at a live demo of the [UBC Timetable](https://ubc-timetable.herokuapp.com/).
