# UBC Timetable
A timetable maker that lets you search up UBC courses, find out where your classes are located, and learn other cool facts about your schedule.

## About
This is my first JavaScript project, written in pure JS with no front end frameworks. My goal is to develop this into a useful tool for UBC students to use when deciding on their course schedule. This project is still in progress and I am still learning lots about JavaScript.

This project has been rewritten in React and is now maintained [here](https://github.com/angusho1/ubc-timetable).
